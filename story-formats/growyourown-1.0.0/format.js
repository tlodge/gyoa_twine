The forest stands at the base of a solitary mountain, its peak almost up among the clouds. As you round a bend in the road you see Ren ahead, standing with another figure… [Ren] You made it! I was starting to get worried... But now you're here, and that's the important thing. We have a job to do… [Torran] Ahem. [Ren] Right, I should make introductions. This is Captain Torran, who serves Queen Elisandra. He's come from the city of Ostrin, away to the west. [Torran] Hello adventurers. I come at the request of the Queen to ask for your help. [Ren] Captain Torran was just about to tell me what they need us to do. [Torran] We're standing at the base of Greyspire peak, and at the summit is Greyspire Keep, which once belonged to the Queen's uncle, Lord Farrow. 10 years ago the fearsome dragon Ignithrax attacked the Keep, killing Lord Farrow and his people and claiming the treasures of the keep for himself and establishing his lair in the ruins. Amongst the treasure is a silver goblet call the Cup of Far Seeing, and her Majesty seeks the return of this treasure as an heirloom of her household. [Ren] So you want us to climb the mountain and retrieve the goblet from the dragon's lair? [Torran] Precisely. You'll be well-rewarded if you survive. [Ren] If we survive?! I'm not sure I like the sound of that! [Torran] Don't worry, our watchers report the dragon sleeps a lot these days, well fed on the giant boar that roam the mountain. [Ren] Well, alright then. I guess we'd better get started… [[3-&gt;Scene Two]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid=\"2\" name=\"Scene Two\" tags=\"Scene-Two\" position=\"200,250\" size=\"100,100\">[Torran] There are many ways up the mountain, adventurers, and may be many challenges along the way! Good luck! [Narration]\tYou follow the road as it emerges from the trees and curves to begin the ascent of Greyspire Peak. It's easy going at first, then the road gets a little steeper as you get higher, before levelling out again once you are well above the tops of the forest trees… [Ren] Can you hear that? Sounds like flowing water… And there's a sign at the side of the road. 'Toll bridge ahead…' [Ren] It's a river! But where's the bridge? [Tollperson] Bridge is closed! [Ren] What bridge? [Tollperson] Well, alright, not so much 'closed' as 'gone'. But either way, you can't cross it. [Ren] I can see that. What happened? [Tollperson] It was an old bridge, and the wood was rotting through… the river was flowing faster after a storm and the struts couldn't take and the whole thing was washed away. [Ren] But we need to cross the river! [Tollperson] Well you can't use the bridge any more, obviously. All that's left is the stone supports, see? [Ren] You mean those big stones? [Tollperson] That's right. [Ren] There's five of them, but they look pretty slippery… I suppose we could try and cross that way. [Tollperson] 'Ere, you haven't paid the toll! [Ren] What? [Tollperson] Nobody crosses the bridge without paying the toll! [Ren] But we're not crossing the bridge, we're crossing the river. [Tollperson] But… I… Well… Oh. [Ren] Right then, let's give this a try… [Ren] Made it! Thank goodness for that. The road picks up again on this side, that's good! We're getting higher now, but there's still a way to go. We'd better keep moving… [[3-&gt;Scene Three]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid=\"3\" name=\"Scene Three\" tags=\"Scene-Three\" position=\"300,400\" size=\"100,100\">[Narration]\tAs you move on the road gets thinner, becoming more like a path and winding through the sparse collection of trees that have grown on the mountain side… [Ren] The trees are getting thinner again now… The summit still looks a long way off though. [Osrik] Greetings travellers! [Ren] Who's that? A stranger up ahead… they're dressed like a hunter.. [Osrik]\tHello! Name's Osrik. What brings you to these parts? [Ren] We're on a quest to the summit. [Osrik]\tReally? You're a braver group than me, that's for sure. [Ren] What are you doing out here then? [Osrik] I'm hunting giant boar. They roam the slopes of the mountain, and- [Ren] What's that noise? [Osrik] Oh dear… Sounds like trouble… [Ren] It's getting louder… and closer! [Osrik] It could be the boar stampeding. It happens when the dragon hunts. [Ren] Stampeding? But it sounds like they're coming this way! [Osrik] If they are, we're in trouble! [Ren] They're coming closer! What shall we do? [Osrik] Quick, we have to get out of their path! [Ren] That's right, everyone find something to climb, we have to get off the ground so they can pass by! [Ren] Here they come! [Ren] Phew! That was close! [Osrik] They don't do that often, we were lucky! [Ren] Thanks for your warning Osrik, but we'd better keep going. We've got to reach the summit! [Osrik]\tGood luck! But be careful, looks like there might be a storm coming… [[3-&gt;Scene Four]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid=\"4\" name=\"Scene Four\" tags=\"Scene-Four\" position=\"400,550\" size=\"100,100\">[Narration]\tThe path winds on and upward and you keep walking. The forest where you began your journey is far below now, and you can see the rest laid out like a blanket beyond it… [Ren] I don't know about you all, but I am getting tired! Maybe we should take a rest. I don't like the look of that sky, either – all grey and ominous… [Ren] It looks likes Osrik was right about the storm! What are we going to do? (Beat) Maybe we can build a shelter to protect us from the storm, and we wait it out! [Ren] It's getting closer, but I think we've got a few minutes. I'm sure if we all work together we can build a shelter in time! Let's all find some things we can use to build with! [Ren] Just in time! Good work everyone, this will keep us nice and cosy for a while! [Ren] There, the skies are clearing again. Let's keep heading for the summit! [[3-&gt;Scene Five]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid=\"5\" name=\"Scene Five\" tags=\"Scene-Five\" position=\"500,700\" size=\"100,100\">[Narration]\tThe mountainside has been washed clean by the rain and the going is easier, though there are some muddy patches of the path. You wend your way around the mountain, still climber ever higher and higher… [Ren] Hold on a minute… Can you smell that? Woodsmoke, and… something cooking! Someone's made a camp up ahead! I wonder who it is… [Ren] I can see the camp ahead… There's a fire and someone's definitely cooking, but… They're a LOT bigger than you or I… Oh no, quick, duck down! [Grom] Eh? Whozat? [Ren] It's an ogre! He's camped right by the path, and he's cooking something… Now ogre's aren't usually friendly, but we should probably check. Let's move a little closer and see if we can find out more… [Grom] Pork and mushrumps it is, always pork and mushrumps… Never a good bit of yooman to be 'ad these days. [Ren] 'Never a good bit of yooman'?! I don't like the sound of that, do you? Sounds like that ogre wants something different for dinner! I think our only choice is to sneak past him if we can. [Grom] Stupid dragon frightening off all the yoomans… Dunno what's so special about treasure anyways… [Ren] It's going to sleep! Now's our chance! Come on, move as quietly as you can… [Ren] Made it! Well done everyone! Let's keep going, we want to get away from that ogre as quick as we can, and we're nearly there now! [[3-&gt;Scene Six]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid=\"6\" name=\"Scene Six\" tags=\"Scene-Six\" position=\"600,850\" size=\"100,100\">[Narration] As you reach the summit of Greyspire Peak you are almost level with the clouds scudding past. Before you lies a deep ravine, and beyond it the path leads right up to the broken gates of the keep. You can see that once there was a stone bridge that spanned the ravine, but all that is left is a stone post on the far side, with an eagle carved atop it… [Ren] What's this? Captain Torran didn't say anything about a ravine! What happened to the bridge? [Stoney] It fell. [Ren] When did that happen? [Stoney] It's quite a recent development. [Ren] Oh, well that's- Hang on! Who's talking?! [Stoney] Over here, on the other side. On the post. The stone eagle? Hello. [Ren] How…? [Stoney] I'm enchanted. I used to be a watchbird of sorts, keeping an eye on those who crossed the bridge and warning against intruders. Not much call for it nowadays, of course, with his scaly meanness in residence. [Ren] Do you know how we can get across? [Stoney] Can you fly? [Ren] No. [Stoney] Me neither. I really wish I could. But if you can fly then I don't know what to suggest really. Unless you have rope? [Ren] Yes! Can you catch it if we through it? [Stoney] Well, no. I'm made of stone. But maybe you can make a loop and throw it over me? Then you can make a rope bridge. [Ren] That could work… Right, let's give it a try! [Stoney] That's it! [Ren] Well done! Okay, let's secure this end and we can cross over… very carefully! [Ren] We made it! Now then, on to the keep and to find the Cup of Far Seeing! We best be quiet though, just in case Ignithrax is awake! [[3-&gt;Scene Seven]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid=\"7\" name=\"Scene Seven\" tags=\"Scene-Seven\" position=\"700,1000\" size=\"100,100\">[Narration] The path leads straight from the ravine to the crumbled stone ruin of Greyspire Keep. As you draw close, moving cautiously, you see the ruin is lit by small fires, probably a result of the dragon's presence. The front wall to the great hall has tumbled down and within you can see piles of treasure glinting in the firelight. Treasure is not the only thing you can see, however… [Ren] Everyone freeze! Ignithrax is there, I can see him curled about the treasure… And look there! Right under his nose, on the top of that pile, a silver cup! [Ren] How can we get it, with the dragon right there? [Ren] We'll have to sneak in! It'll be like the ogre, but… Well, more dangerous. But it'll be fine. We can go in one after the other and make a chain of people… Someone has to get the cup, and then we can pass it down the line… But be as quiet as possible – don't wake the dragon! [Ren] Okay, that's it! We've got the cup, we just need to get everyone out… [Ren] We did it! Amazing! Right, we have the cup, let's get away from here before Ignithrax notices! Well done everyone!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid=\"8\" name=\"Scene Eight\" tags=\"Scene-Eight\" position=\"800,1150\" size=\"100,100\">[Narration]\tYou set off back across the ravine and begin the journey back down the mountain, avoiding the challenges you've already met on the way, until at last you arrive back where you started and find Captain Torran waiting for you. [Torran] You did it! Amazing! Thank you all, on behalf of Queen Elisandra. She will be relieved to know the Cup is safe, and will be pleased to hear there are so many brave adventurers in her kingdom! Here's your promised reward, and don't be surprised if you hear from me again soon!</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata><div id=\"root\"></div></body></html>","description":"This story format will let you record a script for your Twine passages.
