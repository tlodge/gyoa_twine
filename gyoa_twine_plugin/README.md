#Twine custom story format

This illustrates how a custom story format can be creatd in twine for react. 

When you build it will create a format.json file in the build directory.

When you push to git then you can enable pages on the main branch and this will give a
githb.io url (e.g https://tlodge.github.io/growformat/dist/format.js) which you can 
point to as a new story format.
