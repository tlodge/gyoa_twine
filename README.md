## Grow your own app - Twine repository

This repo contains a version of twine with the growyourownstory twine plugin as default.  You should be able to deploy this as a static website through github pages, and once deployed, create new twine stories as needed (details of how to do this follow in this readme.).  If you want to make changes to how the plugin works, the src is in the ./gyoa_twine_plugin directory.
